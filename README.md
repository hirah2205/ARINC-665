# ARINC 665 Tool Suite
![ProjectLogo.svg](ProjectLogo.svg)

Provides library and applications for generating, reading and handling ARINC 665 Media Sets.

This tool suite supports the generation and interpretation of media sets according to ARINC 665-2, ARINC 665-3, ARINC 665-4, and ARINC 665-5.

A library is provided for:
- generating and parsing ARINC 665 files
- media set model, and
- utilities for generation and management of media sets.

An XML format and corresponding tools are provided to ease generation of media sets.

For building graphical applications a Qt based library is provided which consist of models, dialogs, and wizards to work with ARINC 665 media sets.

## Dependencies
First level dependencies:
- [Helper Library](https://git.thomas-vogt.de/thomas-vogt/helper)
- [Qt Icon Resources](https://git.thomas-vogt.de/thomas-vogt/qt_icon_resources)
- [ARINC 645 Tool Suite](https://git.thomas-vogt.de/thomas-vogt/arinc_645)
- [Commands Library](https://git.thomas-vogt.de/thomas-vogt/commands)
- Boost Library
- libxml++

## Building
The library uses CMake to handle build configuration.
CMake Presets are provided to generate builds compiling with:
- GNU GCC,
- Clang, and
- MSVC.

For each compiler and environment, the following variants can be built:
- Static debug,
- Static release,
- Shared debug, and
- Shared release.

Test Environments are:
- Linux,
- Windows MinGW, and
- Windows MSVC.

**Note:**
For managing dependencies, i.e. Windows MSVC, a VCPKG configuration is provided.
